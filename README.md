# UniversitySimulator
I created a simple game of University Simulator as a project for Object oriented programming course at my faculty, made using Visual Studio 2017 in Otter environment and C# programming language. It is a simulation video game where player, as a student has to pass his exams in 10 days,  while improving their skills in a way that after 5th day every skill ("knowledge", "charisma", "fitness") has to be at 50% or more,  and on the 10th day, those skills should be at 90% or more to pass the exams. During the game, limiting factors are "energy" and "stress levels".  The purpose of this project was to showcase the knowledge of object oriented paradigm learnt during the course in the summer semester of 2018. The documentation explains some of the elements of the OOP as well as how those elements were used in the project. Currently, only the Croatian version of documentation is available.  Along with the project and documentation, there is also a .txt file which can be used for preloading a game. Most of the sprites were found online (links attached in documentation).
